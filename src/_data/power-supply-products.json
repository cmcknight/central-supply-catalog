It operates by a controlled flow of antimatter against an ordinary matter core. Flow is metered in response to demand, and very high levels of current are available.<!-- Summary End --> Its two contacts will provide the output of an ACS Power Plant-1 for up to 10 years.\n\nAntimatter batteries are quite resistant to damage, but are not impervious. They have an Armor Value equal to their TL (for a standard antimatter battery, this is AV 25). Penetrating armor will fracture battery casing and release energy.\n\nAntimatter batteries are constructed to bleed energy slowly if broken or cracked. In such a case, the battery will flash brightly for up to one space combat turn (20 minutes) with very bright light and intense heat. Anyone at close range (5m) is subject to Burn-1 per combat round, and Burn-3 at Contact range.\n\nAntimatter batteries may be linked together to gener- ate correspondingly greater power: nine batteries chained together provides the output of an ACS Power Plant-9.",
