When installed, it studies the ship's systems from the ship's computer, using molecular analysis to record a genetic redundancy circuit for the ship's configuration.</li><li><strong>Scan</strong>. Periodically scans the ship's systems for changes in state. New components are added to the overall configuration.</li><li><strong>Restore</strong>. When a system is damaged, it uses the delta generated from the genetic circuit to gradually restore it to its original state, or as close as possible, via molecular fabrication.</li></ul></p><p>Restoration time is measured by Quality, which maps to the number of damage levels the module can repair in a 1-ton (or less) item in one day. The ECM displaces one ton and requires access to raw materials for its operation.</p>",
