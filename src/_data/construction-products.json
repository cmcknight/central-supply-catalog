When installed, it studies the ship's systems from the ship's computer, using molecular analysis to record a genetic redundancy circuit for the ship's configuration.\n\n<strong>Scan</strong>. Periodically scans the ship's systems for changes in state. New components are added to the overall configuration.\n\n<strong>Restore</strong>. When a system is damaged, it uses the delta generated from the genetic circuit to gradually restore it to its original state, or as close as possible, via molecular fabrication.\n\nRestoration time is measured by Quality, which maps to the number of damage levels the module can repair in a 1-ton (or less) item in one day.\n\nThe ECM displaces one ton and requires access to raw materials for its operation.",

Seen from above, the object has a teardrop-like shape.\n\nAny object placed into the opening will be transported within a few seconds out to the range and direction set by the operator.\n\nThe black rubber strip is used to set the transportation range the first push sets the range, and the second push sets the distance above or below the level of the device. The point of the teardrop is pointed in the transportation direction desired. After about 15 minutes, if the device has not been used, the settings revert to their default minimums (10 me- ters range and zero distance above or below the device - that is, on its same level).\n\nObjects must be able to be completely placed inside the compartment for a transport to take place. If any part of an object extends outside of the compartment, it will not be transported.\n\nThis device is a transporter; rather than a teleporter. The object is converted to energy and transmitted to the desired location, where it is converted back to raw matter: a raw dust of element granules.\n\nSome have reported success in making the device operate as a teleporter.",

The user, with the assistance of an on-board Ultimate Model/4phoNN-21 Computer driven by an Improved AI-21 OS and extensive package of standard De/Construction Apps, sets parameters or selects a pre-set template with the desired result. (Note: Weaponized versions carry a variety of Apps with exotic methods for offensive use.) Power for the system is provided by an Early AM Battery-23 (a 10 cm cube providing the equivalent of ACS EP 100) allowing for almost unlimited storage of the system.\n\nThe second part of the system is 0.70 ton of programmable De/Constructor Units held in suspension by the 0.05 ton containment vessel. Once the Molecular Disassembler is powered up and programmed the EAMB-23 charges the D/C Units with enough power to begin executing the task they were given (such as convert this broken down Air/Raft into a small shelter). After initialization the EAMB-23 is expended and is used along with the rest of the infrastructure as starting materials by the D/C Units.\n\nIf power for the containment vessel falls below acceptable levels the Computer will engage the failsafe rendering the system completely inert. Once the failsafe protocol has completed the system is basically usable only as raw materials for another Molecular Dissembler.",
