    "description": "<p><!-- Summary Start -->The robot is very distinct in design. It is roughly dumbell shaped, with a large base and a dome shaped head linked by a wispy torso. <!-- Summary End -->The lower base contains the fusion reactor, Electrostatic Armor array, CG Lifters and Ducted Fans. The torso contains a 3.9 MJ Laser Cannon, and has two arms attached at its upper corners, each ending in a large claw and the business end of a 4mm Gauss Rifle. The head contains the sensors, and the brain in a heavily armored housing. The robots is made out of 2.5 cm or BSD armor, with the electrostatic array providing the equivalent of another 1.25 cm of protection against light antitank and artillery fire.</p><p><h5>History & Background</h5></p><p>The Imperial Marines' first robot was built on the opposite side of the Imperium, away from the Zhodani Consulate. Imperial forces operating in the Solomani Rim had to deal with the heavily \"urbanized\" nature of the sector, and the Marines asked for proposals on robots that could screen their assault forces from enemy units concealed in rubble, alleys, or upper stories of buildings. The winning proposal came from Matsunaga Industries, a mid-sized company on Terra's Japanese Archipelago, in the form of the AD-21. The Marines eventually made it their standard urban recon and screening robot, and the Imperial Army deployed it during the Civil War, principally in factional battles between Lucan and either Dulinor or the Solomani.</p><p>The Imperial Army and Marines disparaged combat robots for reasons now largely obscured by history. Despite a proliferation of less advanced designs among member world militaries, the ground forces considered such machines to be beneath them, considering them to be unmanly or a tactical impediment. That changed after the Zhodani Consulate deployed several warbots during the Fifth Frontier War in their frontline assault forces. The success of these robots embarrassed the Imperial High Command, who \"rediscovered\" their value after an angry outcry from the public and the nobility. A crash program of robot design began immediately in several different parts of the Third Imperium, though it is a measure of the military's disorganization that R&D of these programs was left largely to sector and even subsector oversight. This meant that hundreds of different prototypes were built to an amazing plethora of locally issued specifications. Finally the High Command stepped in and began looking for just a few particular designs to fulfill basic categories.</p>",

Fornol's premier, two ambassadors, and the Sylean vice-mjnister were killed, along with a host of ship's officers and crewmen.

In profile it was nondescript, a flat table of metal supported on a sextet of insect-like legs. It had no discernible head, or any natural way for an observer to distinguish between its front and back for that matter. At any rate these robots were usually stored in utility yards by various authorities on TL-15 worlds in reserve for its intended emergencies. When events did necessitate its deployment, its slow gait and ponderous mass required that it be carried to its destination by larger grav haulers.</p><p>When it did arrive at an incipient emergency, however, the robot came to life in a big way. Large gravitic focusing arrays would sprout like quills along its back from their refuge in various internal compartments to create a tractor beam array that could create 1G acceleration towards the unit for 1260 tons of water. Though that seems niggling given the immensity of even a small pluvial excess, the robot usually works in teams with its fellows to combine their beams, and they would rely more upon physics than brute force.</p><p>In cases of river or channel flooding, the Scylla would either enter the flood path directly to create a faster springflow, cycling water down the deepest part of the channel to prevent backup, or it would travel upstream and create hydrolevees by backing up the current along the banks. Coastal flooding required more ingenuity. To prevent massive tidal bulges and tsunamis, as well as cancel the storm surges from larger storms, the unit would \"pluck\" the sea surface at timed intervals to create wave patterns. These patterns would slosh, adding or subtracting their their energy to create destructive that would negate destructive natural waves.</p>",

It was programmed to patrol all areas of a sensitive installation, seek out and kill or incapacitate unauthorized intruders. Although it is not as mobile as grav-powered units, it is less expensive to operate, and replacement parts are easier to fabricate. This is a wheeled robot which experiences difficulty negotiating stairs, ladders, and any uneven ground. This robot is powered by internal batteries which require recharging every four days. It is armed with a Laser rifle and a 10mm CPR gun firing tranq rounds.</p>",

More often than not, they are bought by corporations and not individuals. The robots are a sign of wealth, power and prestige on many worlds.</p>",
