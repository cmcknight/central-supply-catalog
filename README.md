# Cepheus Supply Catalog

The Cepheus Supply Catalog (CSC) provides an online catalog of equipment and supplies for the Cepheus Engine Science Fiction Role-Playing Game (SFRPG). The catalog is a living resource and allows new entries to be submitted via pull requests. The CSC is hosted on GitHub Pages and is a free resource for the community.
